          <p>Technology is has been a big thing since the 18th century, it has been part of our lives since ages ago. It has been constantly developing and being refined, new ideas has came up, innovations has been created but has technology changed us for the better or for the worse. Many have agreed to disagree, like many things in this realm technology has its advantages and disadvantages. </p>
            
          <p>When it comes to the way we communicate, modern technology has had an impressive influence on communication in the 21st century and daily life in general.In the past, you had to write a letter to communicate with someone. The letter could even take days before it was delivered. You also had to trace the letter to see if it had been sent to and received by the appropriate person. Errors were not uncommon as well.</p>

          <p> Very few students and teachers would disagree with this notion. The advancement in technology has made it possible for teachers to impart knowledge to students from any location. In the past, there had to be a physical contact for any class to hold. Now, there is no specific need for that as both the tutor and the learner can communicate via different media and platforms </p>

           <p>Today how critical thinking has been taken, actually stolen, we see this when whenever a person is given a task or assignment the first thing they do is to ask google. People in this case it's learners and students, they dont give themselves the opportunity to think or even apply their minds in most things.We canâ€™t analyze, understand easily without seeing visual examples. This is how I think technology is impacting our critical thinking.</p>

           <p>Pollution affects the land we grow crops on, the water we drink and the air we breathe. The increased demand for new technologies and advancement of technologies has resulted in many manufacturing and processing factories. As they work so hard to create the best technologies for both society and business, they release harmful chemicals and gasses which have polluted our environment and this has resulted in climate changes (global warming). So the more technology we enjoy, the more we harm our environment.</p>
